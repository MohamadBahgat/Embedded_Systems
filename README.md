# Embedded_Systems
Embedded Systems Projects using ATMega328p.

# Requirements

You have to build a circuit that shows the
density of light using LDR (light dependent resistor).

# Using ATMega328p with a controlled led:

- Configure any pin as an input with an LDR.
- Configure any port as an output using Assembly using ATMEL Studio (see how to connect ATMEL studio to Arduino
development kit on the MET website).
- The output should be displayed on 4 leds showing how intense the light is (on least , 4 highest).
- Burn the code using the Arduino kit.
- Complete the circuit on your breadboard.
- Connect the remaining components and the power supply.

# Aim:

- Understand the benefits of using the development kit
- Learn how to implement ADC
- Practice to be ready for the project later
